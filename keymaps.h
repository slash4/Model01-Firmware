/** The Model 01's key layouts are defined as 'keymaps'. By default, there are three
  * keymaps: The standard QWERTY keymap, the "Function layer" keymap and the "Numpad"
  * keymap.
  *
  * Each keymap is defined as a list using the 'KEYMAP_STACKED' macro, built
  * of first the left hand's layout, followed by the right hand's layout.
  *
  * Keymaps typically consist mostly of `Key_` definitions. There are many, many keys
  * defined as part of the USB HID Keyboard specification. You can find the names
  * (if not yet the explanations) for all the standard `Key_` defintions offered by
  * Kaleidoscope in these files:
  *    https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope/blob/master/src/key_defs_keyboard.h
  *    https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope/blob/master/src/key_defs_consumerctl.h
  *    https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope/blob/master/src/key_defs_sysctl.h
  *    https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope/blob/master/src/key_defs_keymaps.h
  *
  * Additional things that should be documented here include
  *   using ___ to let keypresses fall through to the previously active layer
  *   using XXX to mark a keyswitch as 'blocked' on this layer
  *   using ShiftToLayer() and LockLayer() keys to change the active keymap.
  *   the special nature of the PROG key
  *   keeping NUM and FN consistent and accessible on all layers
  *
  *
  * The "keymaps" data structure is a list of the keymaps compiled into the firmware.
  * The order of keymaps in the list is important, as the ShiftToLayer(#) and LockLayer(#)
  * macros switch to key layers based on this list.
  *
  *

  * A key defined as 'ShiftToLayer(FUNCTION)' will switch to FUNCTION while held.
  * Similarly, a key defined as 'LockLayer(NUMPAD)' will switch to NUMPAD when tapped.

  * the numbers 0, 1 and 2.
